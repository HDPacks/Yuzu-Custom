<h1>Yuzu 12GB for HD Textures (<a href="https://www.hdpacks.com">HDPacks.com</a>)</h1>
<br>
<p>This is the preferred and recommended emulator for HD texture packs from <a href="https://www.hdpacks.com">HDPacks.com</a>. The included memory modes are 12GB, 8GB and the standard 4GB mode. Soon texture packs from <a href="https://www.hdpacks.com">HDPacks.com</a> will be updated to use the extra memory.</p>
<p>The source code contains files that are larger than 100 MB, which Github doesn't permit. If you want to build from source, you should follow the instructions from the official Yuzu repo and copy over the changed files from this repo.</p>
<p><b>Notice:</b> You may have to delete qt-config.ini from Yuzu/Config if you experience crashes during launch. This file contains settings, so save your controller configuration to a profile before you do this. The other possibility is that you are trying to run yuzu in 12GB mode and you don't have enough RAM (32GB is recommended for 12GB mode).</p>
