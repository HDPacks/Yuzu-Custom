<h1>Yuzu Custom for HD Textures</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Notice:</b>At the time of writing, compatibility with HD Texture Packs is not guaranteed. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>This build contains slight memory tweaks for compatibility with HD Texture Packs. Requires Visual Studio 2022 to build.</p>
<p>The source code contains files that are larger than 100 MB, which Github doesn't permit. I might look into Github LFS (large file storage) to upload the source code at some point.</p>
