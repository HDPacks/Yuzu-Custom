<h1>Yuzu Custom for HD Textures</h1>
<br>
<p><b>Notice:</b> You may have to delete qt-config.ini from Yuzu/Config if you experience crashes during launch. The files contains some settings, so save your controller configuration to a profile before you do this.</p>
<p>This build contains slight memory tweaks for compatibility with HD Texture Packs. Requires Visual Studio 2022 to build.</p>
<p>The source code contains files that are larger than 100 MB, which Github doesn't permit. I might look into Github LFS (large file storage) to upload the source code at some point.</p>
